Steps: 

1. make an offline CID tree browser - use perl-Fuse
should be better than go-ipfs in that it does not download data for ls -l
maybe even faster?

2. can make go-ipfs API calls for online fetching of missing content

3. implement online functions in perl
- need dht code for finding the right server to connect to
