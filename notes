https://trello.com/c/9VLyaPM7/367-perl-ipfs

Steps: 

1. make an offline CID tree browser - use perl-Fuse
should be better than go-ipfs in that it does not download data for ls -lR
or find
maybe even faster?
Would be called with base32 or use python multibase for base58 decoding

2. can make go-ipfs API calls for online fetching of missing content

3. implement online functions in perl
3.1 connect directly to another known server and fetch data
3.2 need dht code for finding the right server to connect to
